Nginx UUID filter 
--

Description:
--

Issues identifying cookies. Based on ngx_http_userid_filter_module except that uses libuuid
to generate random uuids AND encodes the ids in 32-bit hex format as opposed to base64 encoded.

Installation:
--

You'll need to re-compile Nginx from source to include this module.
Modify your compile of Nginx by adding the following directive
(modified to suit your path of course):

./configure --add-module=/absolute/path/to/nginx-uuid-filter
make
make install


Usage:
--

Add to your Nginx config file's http block the following directives:

    # Use UUID Module for cookie generation and tracking
    uuid            on;
    uuid_name       cookie_name;
    uuid_domain     .example.com;
    uuid_path       /;
    uuid_expires    max;
    uuid_p3p        'CP="NOI CUR ADM OUR NOR STA NID"';
